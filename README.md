# Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-PC-Fix


This is the Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince d3d9 wrapper.

IMPORTANT READ THE READ ME FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD

Make sure you launch the game one time before you use this fix, go to new game or continue game, go to video and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 for the d3d9.dll to work 

special note:

If you are a user where the FPS does not work correctly and is stuttery when putting in a cap or uncapping in the d3d9 ini file then you must do the following. 

Set the d3d9 ini file FPS cap to 0 so it is uncapped, then open your graphics control panel such as Nvidia Control Panel, go to Manage 3D options, Program settings, select HP6 exe file from drop down or brows and find it, set Low Latency Mode to Ultra, FPS to 278 and V-Sync to Fast then click apply. 

Boot up the game and the FPS should now be fixed. This also fixes the mouse flying around the screen randomly.

If you are using a controller outside of Xbox then add the HP6 exe file to Steam as a non Steam game and play the game via steam. This will allow any controller to be able to function with the game.

simply go to releases download hphbpfix.zip put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini and fps.dll into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go 

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini 

Default for FPS uncap is 280 which is the max you can cap it down to whatever you like in the ini. YOU NEED TO DISABLE VSYNC FOR THE FPS TO BE UNCAPPED.

Default for resolution is 2 (1920 x 1080)

For aspect ratio in this game you need to set two settings if you go above 16:10 which is explained in the ini 

Default aspect ratio is 0 which is (16:9)   

The game will start with the origional FOV and you can toggle it to the FOV you select here by pressing the hotkey "9" on your keyboard (not the numpad) and it will toggle between origional and the value in the ini that you choose to zoom out to.

the three folders with (noFOVtoggle) are the same as the others but you wont have a toggle for FOV in game you will just choose which fov you want in d3d9.ini and it will always be that FOV anytime you open the game
