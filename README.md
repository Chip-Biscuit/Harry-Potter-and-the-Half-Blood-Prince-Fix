Make sure you launch the game one time before you use this fix, go to new game or continue game, go to video and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 for the d3d9.dll to work 

simply go to releases download hphbpfix.zip put the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini and fps.dll into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go 

you can edit settings in d3d9.ini 

Default for FPS uncap is 280 which is the max you can cap it down to whatever you like in the ini. YOU NEED TO DISABLE VSYNC FOR THE FPS TO BE UNCAPPED.

Default for resolution is 2 (1920 x 1080)

For aspect ratio in this game you need to set two settings if you go above 16:10 which is explained in the ini 

Default aspect ratio is 0 which is (16:9)   

The game will start with the origional FOV and you can toggle it to the FOV you select here by pressing the hotkey "9" on your keyboard and it will toggle between origional and the value in the ini that you choose to zoom out to.
